                <h4>Crime and society</h4>
                <p>At the heart of criminal activity is an individual carrying out illegal activity. Understanding the processes that move and shape that activity are therefore crucial to any consideration of crime and society. When the crimes considered are of the most heinous kind, such as the mass shootings examined by Myketiak (Citation2016), then it is tempting to assume that there are unique individual aspects of the culprit that are the cause. Yet as Myketiak demonstrates, the views of the perpetrator she studied are deeply embedded in his reactions to social and societal processes. His extremely low self-esteem is related to the multiple social inequalities he believes he has experienced.

                    A recent issue of Contemporary Social Science is devoted to the many different inequalities that abound and their wide-ranging consequences. But Myketiak’s in-depth study of a mass shooter demonstrates how these inequalities are internalised by an individual to influence his feelings of low-self worth. Society cannot be blamed for his violent actions, but the social inequalities he perceives go some way to explain his developing anger and frustration.</p>

            <h4>The systemic challenge of crime</h4>
            <p>The central message that emerges from all these studies is that criminality is an integral part of how society, and its culture, is constructed. Thinking of crime as generated by abnormal individuals that is the responsibility of law enforcement and the judicial system is to ignore the endemic processes that sustain it and those who deal with it on a daily basis. Therefore the innovative approach to reducing sexual abuse and violence on university campuses presented by Graham Towl (Citation2016) is instructive in demonstrating a holistic, socially oriented approach to tackling a growing problem.
                Towl’s starting point is that the institution should unashamedly recognise the existence of a problem. This means addressing the unwarranted fear that such recognition will damage the institutions reputation. He shows that once the issue is out in the open prevention procedures can be put in place. </p>

            <h4>To get married, lovebirds become partners in crime.</h4>
            <p>A young couple in Lucknow, inspired by the Bollywood movie 'Bunty Aur Babli', turned to snatching bags and phones to earn money for their wedding. They were arrested along with their accomplice who posed as a cop. The gang targeted wealthy people in Lucknow after moving from Ghazipur.In an incident reminiscent of Bollywood flick 'Bunty Aur Babli' in which the lead couple robbed and conned people, a young couple took to snatching bags, phones and other valuable items in Lucknow to earn enough money to tie the knot.
                However, they ran out of luck and fell in the police net along with their aide, who used to stand guard near the crime scene to come to their rescue, posing as a cop, in case they get caught.Police said that the trio, identified as Shivam Rai, Himanshu Yadav and Khushi (all of them aged 19), had recently come to Lucknow from Ghazipur after coming to know that there are many rich people in the state capital. Shivam has a criminal history with seven cases against him while his girlfriend, Khushi, and their aide, Himanshu, have three cases each against them.
