                <h4>Nutrition self-efficacy intervention to improve nutritional status of Iranian older adults</h4>
                <p>The nutritional status of the elderly in West Asia, particularly in India and Saudi Arabia, presents significant challenges. In India, studies have shown that malnutrition among older adults is a prevalent problem, with rates ranging from 14.3 to 19%1 [1]. In Saudi Arabia, a cross sectional study found that 17.9% of community-dwelling older adults were malnourished, with factors such as overweight or obesity, poor oral health, and depression being associated with malnutrition. Additionally, in Southwest Ethiopia, 48.1% of elderly people were malnourished or at risk of malnutrition, with a higher prevalence in urban areas [2].
                    According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the number of older adults is projected to increase significantly in the coming decades [3]. Improving healthcare in recent decades and increasing life expectancy have indeed led to a growing older adults, especially in developing countries. According to the latest census conducted in 2016, about 9.2% of the total population of Iran are people aged 60 and older, which is equivalent to 7 million and 414 thousand people. This figure is expected to reach 21 to 26 million people by 2050, equivalent to 26% of the total population of Iran [4].</p>

            <h4>Happiness and air quality: microdata analysis in Indonesia</h4>
            <p>Indonesia always targets its economic growth annually. Economic growth is expected to impact the Indonesian population, including individual happiness. Happiness is an essential indicator of life [50]. Happiness is part of subjective well-being (SWB) that can describe economic and social conditions [44]. Happiness is also known as life satisfaction. Since 2013, the Indonesian economy has grown by around 4–5% per year. On the other hand, Indonesia's World Happiness Index [19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27] ranges from 5.1 to 5.3 every year. In other words, even though Indonesia's economy is growing every year, Indonesia's level of happiness remains constant.

                Happiness has several causal factors, including physical; social and environmental conditions; and wealth [6]. Liu et al. [39] find a positive relationship between health and happiness. Farhud et al. [9] also found that health and physical attractiveness significantly influence individual happiness. Environmental conditions, especially air quality, are considered to influence individual happiness. Yuan et al. [53] stated that poor air quality had a negative impact on happiness levels. Sanduijav et al. [45] argue that air pollution (PM10) negatively impacts someone’s happiness by concerning his/her family’s health.
                
                Environmental impacts can be measured from several things, for example, air quality. Air quality is an environmental problem not a concern in developing countries [34]. Poor air quality can cause various diseases [7]. </p>

            <h4>Impact of COVID-19 on food security and diet quality in Chilanga District, Zambia</h4>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has had a notable impact on food security and the nutritional well-being of many populations around the world [1]. This adverse impact has been in large part due to public health measures implemented across the globe at the start of the pandemic which were intended to curb the spread of COVID-19 [2, 3]. While these public health measures were critical in the containment of the disease and given the severity of symptoms and long-term health effects of SARS-CoV-2 [4, 5], the side effects of the lockdowns included economic, mental health, education, and food security challenges particularly in adolescent populations across sub-Saharan Africa [3, 6]. These measures also had a dramatic effect at the community level, often with the most vulnerable populations being differentially affected [1]. This global decline in food security has ultimately diminished the nutritional status of communities as food security is closely linked with nutritional security, particularly in regard to quantity and quality of food [7]. While food security alone is not enough to ensure nutritional security of a community, this is a fundamental necessity to promote adequate nutrition of children, adolescents, and families. Given this, the dramatic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic must be adequately quantified to ensure that funds are properly distributed to those communities with the greatest need as we move out of the pandemic and into a “new normal” [8].

            <h4>Association of dietary fats with ischemic heart disease (IHD): a case–control study</h4>
            <p>Among non-communicable illnesses, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) account for more than 70% of the global mortality [1]. Ischemic heart disease (IHD), also known as coronary artery disease (CAD) or coronary heart disease (CHD), is the most prevalent type of CVDs, produced by an is related to the creation of atherosclerosis [2]. According to the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, IHD affects about 126 million people which is equal to 1.72% of the world’s population (1655 per 100,000). IHD was reported to be responsible for 9 million fatalities worldwide [3]. In Iran, the incidence rate reached 829.1 new cases (719.9–945.2) per 100,000 persons in 2019 [4]. Lifestyle management including having a healthy diet and proper physical activity, and also treatment of risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and lipid disorders may prevent IHD [5].

                The studies on the link between IHD and dietary fats reported contradictory results. For example, in China, dietary fat consumption grew from 15.9% of calories in 1982 to 21.1% in 1990 and in the meantime IHD incidence and death likewise increased [6]. An unmatched case–control study which was conducted in Ethiopia indicated that poor diets such as cooking with palm oil and consuming fewer fruits and vegetables were related to IHD [7]. Some types of fatty acids were reported to be associated with IHD [8]. For example, epidemiological studies found a link between n−3 fatty acid consumption and a lower risk of IHD. This impact may be caused by changes in eicosanoid production and cholesterol levels [9].</p>
