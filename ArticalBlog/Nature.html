                <h4>Soils in Food Systems</h4>
                <p>Soils are vital for food production, biodiversity conservation, and climate regulation. Understanding the links between soil health, agriculture, and environmental 
                    sustainability is essential to achieve food security and the Sustainable Development Goals.
                    This Collection highlights primary research, reviews, and commentary pieces on the latest advances in agricultural 
                    soil management, soil microbiology and biogeochemistry from across the Nature Portfolio. We hope this collection will stimulate conversations across research communities and guide future policy choices.</p>

            <h4>The plant microbiome</h4>
            <p>The UN General Assembly proclaimed that 2020 is the International Year of Plant Health to recognize and protect plant health, and to raise awareness of the crucial role of plant health in ecosystem health, food security and human health. Plants host diverse microbial communities that are associated with plant roots, the phyllosphere, rhizosphere and the endosphere, and comprise bacteria, fungi, protists, nematodes and viruses. Numerous studies from different fields of research have expanded our knowledge of the complex interactions between the plant, the associated microbial communities as well as the environment, and provided insights into the ecology and functions of this co-association, including the appreciation that the plant microbiota is important for plant growth, fitness, stress resilience and health. Such an increased understanding opens up the possibility to harness plant-associated communities for sustainable plant production and agricultural practises and to protect plants from the effects of climate change and human activities that lead to a decrease in biodiversity and the spread of plant diseases.</p>

            <h4>Plastics in the environment</h4>
            <p>Every day, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic are dumped into the world's oceans, rivers, and lakes. Plastic pollution is a global problem. Every year 19-23 million tonnes of plastic waste leaks into aquatic ecosystems, polluting lakes, rivers and seas.Plastic is ubiquitous in our lives and the environment. This Collection brings together research and opinion on the occurrence, transport, and fate of plastics in the environment, and outlines opportunities for its prospective management.</p>

            <h4>Research in support of COP26</h4>
            <p>This November, world leaders will meet in Glasgow, UK for the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26) to discuss action on the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. Science and research played a critical role in identifying and understanding the drivers and impacts of climate change and they are key in delivering solutions to address it. This Collection draws together content from across the Nature Portfolio that discusses solutions to challenges in mitigation, adaptation and finance — key pillars for COP26. The Collection also presents four Q&As with advisors and decision-makers from different parts of the globe on the science–policy interface and their hopes for COP26.</p>
