                <h4>An Out-of-Control Rocket is about the Hit the Moon</h4>
                <p>A rocket set to slam into the moon next month, initially identified as belonging to SpaceX, has now been identified as a Chinese rocket.

                    Last month, an amateur astronomer, Bill Gray, suggested the rogue object was likely a spent SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from a 2015 launch and was going to collide into the Moon on 4 March.
                    
                    He now believes the object is not a SpaceX Falcon 9 part, but an old Chinese rocket instead.
                    
                    Bill Gray who has been tracking asteroids as part of Project Pluto, has been following this space object since March of 2015.But unlike a typical asteroid, astronomers noticed that this object wasn’t orbiting the sun but was actually orbiting the Earth, suggesting that it was manmade space junk.

                    Gray and others mistakenly thought the object was the top portion of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket that had launched in February 2015.
                    
                    However, Gray admits that identifying space objects can be tricky. ‘I had pretty good circumstantial evidence for the identification, but nothing conclusive,’ Gray wrote in a new blog post, first reported by Ars Technica.
                    
                    A closer look at the object’s history and additional information from Nasa has now convinced Gray that the object is a leftover piece of a Chinese rocket from one of China’s moon missions.</p>

            <h4>Why Mercury Matters</h4>
            <p>At first, the planet Mercury isn't much to look at. It has a surface only a mother could love, as desolate and empty as the Moon and pock-marked with crater after crater. But this planet has a secret, which has folks wanting to know more.Mercury is the smallest of the four inner rocky worlds of the solar system, not even half the width of the Earth. And it's mostly just a big ball of rock. So why did NASA send the Mariner 10 probe to the planet in 1974? And the MESSENGER spacecraft a decade ago? And why did the Japanese and European space agencies join forces to develop BepiColumbo, a two-craft space probe that will reach the planet in 2025?
                Because Mercury has a secret.
                Yes, by all accounts Mercury is a dead world. You can tell that by its craters. Worlds capable of active resurfacing, like from plate tectonics or weathering, will eventually erase their scars. That’s why you don’t see a lot of craters on the surface of the Earth. But you do see them on Mercury – it hasn’t been molten in a long, long time.</p>

            <h4>Will a Colony on Mars Ever Be Feasible?</h4>
            <p>When it comes to visions of human colonization of the solar system, Mars is hard to beat. Sure, presumably someday we’ll have some folks living and working up on the moon, but that’s practically right next door. Which is boring. Mars is fresh. Mars is a planet in its own right. Mars has been a home for life.

                Mars is… a challenge.There’s no air. Well, there’s air, but it’s 1% of the air pressure of the Earth’s atmosphere, and it’s made of poisonous carbon dioxide.

                There’s no water. Well, there is water, but it’s frozen, either buried under the dirt or locked in polar ice caps.
                
                There’s no gravity. Well, there is gravity, but it’s weaker than the Earth’s. Forget living for extended periods of time in a low-gravity environment – can fetuses even develop a straight spine without the strong gravity of the Earth?
                
                There’s nothing alive, at least not anymore.</p>

            <h4>Yet Another Exoplanet That You’ll Never Want to Visit</h4>
            <p>Identified with NASA’s TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) observatory and confirmed with the European Southern Observatory in Chile, GJ 267b is located about 30 light-years away from Earth.

                This world has only 72% the radius of the Earth but only a little more than half its mass. It’s so close to its parent star that a “year” on GJ 267b is only 7.7 of our hours long. That makes GJ 267b to be the first known ultrashort-period planet (a kind of planet with years measured in days) that is smaller and lighter than the Earth.
                
                What is GJ 267b? It has a density of about 8.1 grams per cubic centimeter, which is just a little less than the density of solid iron. That suggests that the entire planet is mostly iron, surrounded by a thin, rocky crust, like the shell of a piece of candy only on the inside it’s not sugar but iron.</p>
