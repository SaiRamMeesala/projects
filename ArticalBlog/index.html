                <h4>Soils in Food Systems</h4>
                <p>Soils are vital for food production, biodiversity conservation, and climate regulation. Understanding the links between soil health, agriculture, and environmental 
                    sustainability is essential to achieve food security and the Sustainable Development Goals.
                    This Collection highlights primary research, reviews, and commentary pieces on the latest advances in agricultural 
                    soil management, soil microbiology and biogeochemistry from across the Nature Portfolio. We hope this collection will stimulate conversations across research communities and guide future policy choices.</p>

                <h4>Science at Extreme Pressures</h4>
                <p> Under extreme pressure, matter can exhibit novel or counter-intuitive phenomena such as superconductivity at unusually high-temperature, unexpected chemical stoichiometries and reaction kinetics, or new material phases. These behaviours have implications for fields such as fundamental physics,  Earth and planetary sciences, and material synthesis. However, high pressure experimental and theoretical tools are highly complex and under constant development.

                    This Collection highlights recent publications from the Nature Portfolio  that explore material properties at extreme pressure to complement the Nature Conference “Frontiers of High Pressure Research – Science under Extreme Conditions” (November 21-23, 2022), organized with HPSTAR (Center for High Pressure Science & Technology Advanced Research), SHARPS (Shanghai Advanced Research in Physical Sciences), the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Jilin University, Yanshan University and Sichuan University. </p>

                <h4>Renewed emissions of ozone depleting substances</h4>
                <p>International agreements – such as the Montreal Protocol and associated Kigali Amendment - have been largely successful in reducing emissions of ozone depleting substances. However, in recent years, some of these emissions have been observed to increase once more. These renewed, unreported emissions raise questions about potential gaps in international agreements and associated scientific monitoring. In this collection, we bring together both research articles on the physical evidence for renewed emissions and their consequences, as well as opinion articles outlining important next steps to secure a recovery of stratospheric ozone.</p>

                <h4>Natural Hazards</h4>
                <p>When nature strikes with force, the effects can be devastating. It is critically important to better study and understand natural hazards to help mitigate against their effects. In this collection, we focus on geological hazards such as volcanic eruptions, tectonic earthquakes and mass movements.A natural disaster is the highly harmful impact on a society or community following a natural hazard event. Some examples of natural hazard events include: flooding, drought, earthquake, tropical cyclone, lightning, tsunami, volcanic activity, wildfire.</p>

                <h4>Crime as a reflection of society</h4>
                <p>At the heart of criminal activity is an individual carrying out illegal activity. Understanding the processes that move and shape that activity are therefore crucial to any consideration of crime and society. When the crimes considered are of the most heinous kind, such as the mass shootings examined by Myketiak (Citation2016), then it is tempting to assume that there are unique individual aspects of the culprit that are the cause. Yet as Myketiak demonstrates, the views of the perpetrator she studied are deeply embedded in his reactions to social and societal processes. His extremely low self-esteem is related to the multiple social inequalities he believes he has experienced.
                    A recent issue of Contemporary Social Science is devoted to the many different inequalities that abound and their wide-ranging consequences. But Myketiak’s in-depth study of a mass shooter demonstrates how these inequalities are internalised by an individual to influence his feelings of low-self worth. Society cannot be blamed for his violent actions, but the social inequalities he perceives go some way to explain his developing anger and frustration. 
                    The other side of this experience are public attitudes to minorities that influence their experiences. Bulut’s (Citation2016) review of prejudice towards Muslims shines an interesting light on the basis for such attitudes. She reveals that, contrary to commonly held views, widespread negative attitudes towards Muslims are not based on fear of violence in the wake of terrorist attacks, notably those of 9/11, but rather the view that the American way of life is the best and any sub-culture that is different from that is a threat to the traditional American values. It is therefore a lack of contact with Muslims and a belief that they are fundamentally ‘un-American’ that gives rise to prejudice against them. Thus, the well-established finding in relation to attitudes to other ethnic minorities</p>

            <h4>The plant microbiome</h4>
            <p>The UN General Assembly proclaimed that 2020 is the International Year of Plant Health to recognize and protect plant health, and to raise awareness of the crucial role of plant health in ecosystem health, food security and human health. Plants host diverse microbial communities that are associated with plant roots, the phyllosphere, rhizosphere and the endosphere, and comprise bacteria, fungi, protists, nematodes and viruses. Numerous studies from different fields of research have expanded our knowledge of the complex interactions between the plant, the associated microbial communities as well as the environment, and provided insights into the ecology and functions of this co-association, including the appreciation that the plant microbiota is important for plant growth, fitness, stress resilience and health. Such an increased understanding opens up the possibility to harness plant-associated communities for sustainable plant production and agricultural practises and to protect plants from the effects of climate change and human activities that lead to a decrease in biodiversity and the spread of plant diseases.</p>
